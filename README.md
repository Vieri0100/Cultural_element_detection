## Acknowledgment

This project is inspired by the TensorFlow.js object detection tutorial by Hugo Zanini, which provides an excellent introduction to creating custom object detection models and deploying them in real-time in a web browser. I sincerely appreciate the effort and detailed walkthrough presented in his repository, which served as a valuable guide for my project.
